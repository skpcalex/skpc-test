# skpc-test
# this is a simple scoop package and bucket I have made that simply makes my job quite a bit easier.
# I don't know any JSON or PS1 languages so I have in fact being getting gray hairs while trying to not pull my hair out.

the documentation for making a package was not very good, at least for me, so I looked for alternatives.
